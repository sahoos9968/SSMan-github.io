        The mountainous city of Anchorage should definetly have your eyes layed upon. This northern metropolis is close to the coast <br>

        Out of all the national parks in Alaska, this one is my favorite, after the Denali Nat. Park, of course. This 'valley' is located on the banks of the northerly Kobuk River. Suprisingly, there are also sand dunes located here, and they are reputed to be extremely scorching during the summer. It is very ironic for that to happen in a place well above the Arctic Circle. Its one of the world's only Arctic Deserts.
